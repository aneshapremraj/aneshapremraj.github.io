    <h1>Test Page</h1>
    <p>
      A repo is linked to a special webpage and GitHub is not necessarily for posting webpages, however, it allows us to do so.
      You can update the webpage(s). To do that, you must make changes to the files in Atom.
      You sync these changes in GitHub for desktop, allowing the file from your computer to be live on the server.
      You must commit to these changes on GitHub for desktop and sync your changes to the repo.
      This will allow your website to be live through your repo.
