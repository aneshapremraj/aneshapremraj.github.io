    <h1>PART MEDIUM: GROUP FEEDBACK</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Very engaging and interesting approach at a pretty boring subject.
      </li>
      <li>
        Out of the box thinking for the "easy" part of the assignment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not everybody in the group was engaging or seemed to put in an effort, but I get it, it is a pretty boring topic. All is forgiven.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>PART HARD: COMPANY FEEDBACK</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
Very jumbled design for a  website, it needs more space between texts.
      </li>
      <li>
Colour do not compliment each other at all. White would go better with red and pink.
      </li>
      <li>
The font could be nicer, more welcoming and lovey dovey.
      </li>
    </ul>
